# coffee_machine
This one of the projects I was asked to build from scratch. This is my solution before watching the solution video proviced. 
For this, I tried using more functions.
Having the data in dictonaries that also had nested dictonaries really through me off. 
Had to really think on how I was going to pull data and manipulate it into my code.
I'm hoping my solution is optimal. 
What I would maybe do differently next time is maybe make another function that checked my payment and return whether or not I owed money.
